Hello :)

This is some kind of Poker game :)

I starded it a little bit, it has 2 "hands", and you can choose witch cards to keep

I am still learning JavaScript, this mini-project I found on  Danilo Vesovic YouTube channel,
and it was interesting to me, so I did it

Also, it is done with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
